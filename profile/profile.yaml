# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: A software enthusiast who is passionate about developing applications. During my academic years, I developed several projects using technologies like Flutter, Firebase, and Google APIs. Thereafter, pursuing a career in software became my prime focus. Recently, I started working at Jarvis as a Data Engineer. At Jarvis, our team used the Agile methodology which helped me align with industry-standard SDLC. Moreover, I was able to put my time-management, problem-solving and organizational skills to work by developing applications. Implementation of these applications helped me become proficient in technologies like Version Control, Java, Bash Scripting, RDBMS(SQL), Maven, Docker, JDBC, CLI. I aspire to deliver world-class applications along with pursuing my passion to learn new technologies.

  - name: "Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # Please read the project description guideline carefully. Make sure you follow the simplified SDLC pattern. (t.ly/NlXQ)
    # Please include the following keywords: CentOS, Bash/Shell, docker, RDBMS/SQL/Postgresql, crontab, data analytics
    description: "Developed a monitoring agent using Bash scripts that keep an active track of resource usage statistics of a node in a network. Postgres container mounted on a Docker engine is used as a Database. SQL queries were used for data analysis which also includes an error detection query to check if crontab is updating values on a timely basis. The Bash Scripts are automated using crontab. The agent was run in a CentOS 7 virtual machine on the Google Cloud Platform."

      #Keywords: Java 8, REST API, OAuth, Design patterns (e.g. DAO, MVC), JUnit, Mockito, Docker
      #- "Twitter CRUD App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam."
      # Keywords: Java 8, JDBC, RDBMS, SQL, CRUD,DAO
      - "JDBC App: Worked on a Java application using JDBC API to connect to a PostgreSQL database. The app allows users to perform CRUD operations and is built using the DAO(Data Access Object) pattern. Maven is used as Project Management Tool."
      # Keywords: Java 8, Lambda, Stream API, IntelliJ
      - "Grep App: Reimplemented the popular LINUX grep command as a Java App. The application recursively searches through a given directory for a supplied Regex pattern. The matched lines are then written in a text file. The application was improvised by Java 8 features Lambda and Stream API. Streams and Lambda helped in reducing memory usage and inducing a declarative programming approach. IntelliJ was used as IDE and the project was built using Maven. The app is deployed on DockerHub using Docker."

    description: Designed and Developed a Parking Detection system in a Raspberry Pi and Intel Neural Compute Stick. The system used Yolo v3 Real-time Object detection algorithm to process images supplied by Pi cam. The number of parking spots was conveyed from Raspberry Pi to Firebase using Python and Web API. The data received in real-time was broadcast to the client-side web application. The web app was developed using Flutter and Dart programming language. Additionally, the web app used google authentication API and Map API for authentication and GUI purposes.
