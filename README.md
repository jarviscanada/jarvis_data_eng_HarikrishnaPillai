# Harikrishna S Pillai . Jarvis Consulting

A Software engineering enthusiast who is passionate in developing applications. Graduated in 2020 from Centennial College with focus on embedded systems where I developed several programs written in assembly language which communicated with microcontrollers. Working at Jarvis helped me realize my passion for programming and developing real world applications. Looking to leverage my acumen by working on challenging products and services.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HarikrishnaSPillai](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HarikrishnaSPillai)


**Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HarikrishnaSPillai/tree/master/linux_sql)]: The monitoring agent does the job of actively keeping an eye on the usage statistics which helps in effective resource management.This is possible with help of several different technologies working in tandem. The monitoring agent works on each node inserting values every minute from the node into postgres SQL database which mounted on a container using Docker.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HarikrishnaSPillai/tree/master/core_java)]:

- **Grep App** : The grep Java application is the java implementation of the much popular 'grep' UNIX command. The program scans through files that are in directory and looks for a Regex Pattern (Regular Expression). Once matched copies all those matching lines and saves it to text file that can be specified when calling the program.
- **JDBC** : The jdbc app leverages the JDBC Api to perform basic (CRUD) operations with Postgres Database which is live container on local machine. The Structural pattern used in this project is Data Access Object pattern.

## Highlighted Projects
**Employee Trends of Salary, Gender Equality** [[GitHub](https://github.com/HarikrishnaSPillai/SQL-employees)]: The project involves efficient use of DML to extract insights from thousands of records to showcase how metrics like age, gender equality and salaries have progressed through years.The data which was extracted was visualized using Tableau.

**Real Time Parking Spot Detection** [[GitHub](https://github.com/HarikrishnaSPillai/)]: Designed and Developed a system where Raspberry Pi works with TensorFlow to calculate the number of parking spots available, the data thus obtained is sent to users with Firebase and a Flutter app(Google Auth and Map API) on the client side
